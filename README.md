# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Description

Learning Objectives
* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm

---

### [0. Bubble sort](./0-bubble_sort.c)
* A function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm

### [1. Insertion sort](./1-insertion_sort_list.c)
* A function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm

### [2. Selection sort](./2-selection_sort.c)
* A function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm

### [3. Quick sort](./3-quick_sort.c)
* A function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm

### [Header File](./sort.h)
* Header file containing all the functions prototypes and structures used in this project
